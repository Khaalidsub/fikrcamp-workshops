# What Is Typescript ?
Typescript is javascript with statically typed Types. 
Like Java, It will compile the code and transform to a different readable language, which in this case would be javascript(since most of the browsers are not cabable to read typescript, hence the requirement of compiling)
This transformation is called Trans-piling (not necessary to know, but just to keep it consistent with the wordings)

# Why Use Typescript ?
if you code alone, javascript would be enough, since you may know all the function types or object types within the system. But what about other people who do not know about the passings of object types or the return of a function? this is where typescript shines, allowing your code to have types that your team would be able to know what types it is returning. The faster your team is able to understand the system , the faster the project could be developed (not completed since developing a system is a never ending process)

Oh yes, did I mention that you will have intellisense 
## Installation Setup
First install it globally
``
npm install -g typescript
```
This will allow you to have the super magically intellisense!
